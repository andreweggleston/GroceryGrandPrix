# GroceryGrandPrix
A single player stat-based racing game loosely based on Pocket Circuit Fighter from Yakuza Zero

A player starts the game after they have selected their car's appearance and stats.
Then, A track is procedurally generated, with 4 starting positions.

The player and the 3 computer racers travel around the track, all the way back to their starting position.

The racer which finishes last is eliminated and the rest of the racers continue on to the next round.
